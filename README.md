# Asher's Toolbox

Asher's Toolbox (ATB) is a Blender add-on that re-shuffles and re-wraps existing Blender features, aiming to speed up common tasks without enforcing a particular workflow or overloading the user's keymap.

## Main Interfaces

ATB is, at its core, a pile of interfaces. Here are the main ones you'll interact with:

### In The Sidebar: The Overlays Panel

The overlays panel is a more-or-less straight remix of the shading and overlay popovers in the viewport header, with a few object display and theme settings thrown in for good measure. This panel has been designed to work with a fairly narrow column width, which makes it great for situations where you're toggling overlays off and on and you don't want to deal with popovers.

### In The Keymap: The Fast Panel

Think of the fast panel as a compact one-stop-shop for object display settings. It's great for controlling things like the display mode of Boolean cutters, geometry data overlays, and x-ray shading.

While the fast panel does have a few tabs for future features, those tabs haven't been filled yet.

### In The Viewport Header: The Meta Panel

The meta panel splits the difference between the overlays panel and the fast panel. It's more compact than the former, but more exhaustive than the latter, providing convenient access to transform settings, gizmo settings, viewport settings, and object data.

The object data tab is currently the most useful one, since it lets you manage vertex groups, curve settings, light settings, and so on, when you're working in full screen mode.
